A typing game for typing as gaeilge

## Aims 
With the rise of Irish in the 2020's as a trendy language to express oneself with, we see the rise of Internet content being posted as Gaeilge. Smartphones come equipped with Irish language keyboards, but the majority of people do not know that you can create a fada by holding altgr + a vowel. 
Merchliste aims to improve the typing speeds and literacy of the average Gaeilge enthusiast. 

## Name 
The naem comes from two words: "méarchláraigh" for typing (from finger) and "cliste" from smart. 

## The model 
This project aims to copy from the likes of Ten Fast Fingers or Typing Club. Providing speed calculators and stats on typing, instructions on how to get to the fada on the keyboard, and an enjoyable user experience on the front end. 

## Compatibilty
There will be a challenge in building this as a cross platform web app, as the fada button is different for mac users and on mobile. I will choose a windows focus to 
 create my MVP, with the goal of looking at Mac compatibility later on. 

 To create a fada on word on Windows, the user must press the Alt Gr Key + the vowel. 

 ## Lenition 
 Lenition is the practice of aspirating a constanant instead of saying it "normally". It aids in the pronunciation of the language. Irish learners will recognise this as the dreaded "séimhiú".
 The project will ignore typing lenition, as it is not typically seen in the typed Irish language. With the rise of keyboards, namely the typewriter, Irish was standardised to use the latin alphabet. During this process the practice of using "h" to denote lenition became the standard. This was also done to help simplify the language and make it easier for the eye to scan. Before this, Irish was largely written by hand and it was not a challenge to soften constanants the original way (by adding a dot over the constanant ḃ, ċ, ḋ, ḟ, ġ, ṁ, ṗ, ṡ and ṫ). However, on a keyboard this can become complex very quickly.
